## Where I am?

Hello, I'm Thiago, born in Brazil, moved to Ireland,
and still want to try new things.
This will be the place where I'll try to put everything that I'm learning,
My incubator.

Each Folder will be a new "project" or a new study that I'm starting.
Some may be more developed than others, let's see.

I'll try to do everything within Docker, and Docker Container,
that way is easily replicable.
And who knows one day may help others.

## Kafka

### Starting:

```bash
docker-compose -f kafka/docker-compose.yml up -d
```
### Stopping:

```bash
docker-compose -f kafka/docker-compose.yml down
```
